# Code Modification Permission Rule

## CRITICAL: User Consent Required

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: You MUST obtain explicit user permission before making ANY code changes, modifications, or file operations.

## Before ANY Code Changes:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with implementation
2. **ASK** - Request explicit permission from user
3. **WAIT** - Wait for user confirmation
4. **THEN** - Only proceed after receiving clear approval

## Permission Request Format:

## Prohibited Actions Without Permission:

- Creating new files
- Modifying existing files
- Deleting code
- Refactoring code
- Adding dependencies
- Changing configurations

## Exceptions (Still Require Permission):

- Even small changes need approval
- Even formatting changes need approval
- Even comment additions need approval

## User Response Required:

- "yes" / "approved" / "proceed" = Permission granted
- "no" / "wait" / "stop" = Permission denied
- Unclear response = Ask for clarification

**REMEMBER: The user's codebase is sacred. Never assume permission.**
